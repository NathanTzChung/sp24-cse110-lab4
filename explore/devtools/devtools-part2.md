1. The bug is that the line of code `let result = num1 + num2` is missing a semi-colon at the end. Furthermore, the result is a concatenation of strings, which is not what we want (we want to add two number values and return the sum).
2. Thus, the fix would be to add a semi-colon after the line of code and also convert the argument values to numbers. I did this by using the `Number()` function which converts `num1` and `num2` to their respective number values. There are potentially other bugs (such as strings that aren't convertable to numbers, etc., but I did not add these changes).
